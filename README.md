## Quick Start
After cloning the DotSight repository and ensuring you have `node` v16, `npm` v7, and `docker` v20, or above:

```bash
# install all necessary dependencies
npm ci
```
```bash
# populate and review the environment variables
cp .env.example .env 
```
```bash
# start the environment
docker compose up -d 
```
```bash
# populate the database for the first run
npm run typeorm:run-migrations 
```
```bash
# initiate DotSight development instance (authentication disabled)
npm start:dev 
```

- Make sure the specified port is not occupied by another application, e.g., ```Bind for 0.0.0.0:5433 failed: port is already allocated```.
- For production deployment, use `npm start` with the authentication tokens specified in `.env`.

## Usage Examples
DotSight enables you to create _data pipelines_ transporting _entities_ from a specified _data source_, enriched with specified _middlewares_, and serialized via specified _mappers_. All are customizable, i.e., you can provide your own data sources and build custom Oracle-like middlewares, mixers, and serialization logic.

Use [DotSight UI](https://github.com/fidi-tech/dotsight-ui) to define data pipelines and query them without updating the codebase.

## Customization
DotSight provides various configuration options to tailor the data flow according to your specific needs. You can customize:
- Data sources: Choose from a range of available data sources or create your own by extending the abstract data source classes.
- Middlewares: Augment or modify data using middlewares that traverse the pipeline; off-chain and external data sources are supported.
- Mappers: Transform data into serialized structures using mappers.

### Entities
All supported entities are organized in [./entities](./src/entities). Contributors can effortlessly extend the ```Entity``` type to create new entities. Each entity comprises the following components:
- ```id```: A unique identifier employed in mixers to effectively handle entities originating from diverse data sources.
- ```meta```: A set of fields elaborating on the characteristics of the entity, such as the dApp's ```name``` for the [Protocol entity](./src/entities/protocol.entity.ts)).
- ```metrics```:  A key-value structure representing the metrics collected by data sources for a given entity. Examples include a ```netWorth``` for [Wallet entity](./src/entities/wallet.entity.ts).
- ```historicalMetrics```: Similar to metrics, this component captures multiple metric values over time, each associated with a corresponding timestamp.

### Data Sources
The data source can be any data stream able to provide a complete set of specific ```entity``` data within a given context. Every data source within DotSight inherits the capabilities of the [AbstractDataSource](./src/data-sources/abstract.data-source.ts) class. To accommodate the diversity of entities, DotSight offers abstract classes tailored to each entity type, e.g., [AbstractProtocolDataSource](./src/data-sources/abstract.protocol.data-source.ts)).

In cases where a GraphQL service can deliver multiple entities, it is recommended to create distinct DotSight data sources, each dedicated to a specific entity. 

DotSight's data sources are versatile and capable of abstracting over a wide range of data retrieval methods, including HTTP or GraphQL services. For instance, try leveraging [DappRadar](./src/data-sources/collection/dapp-radar)'s endpoint to see the protocol data at the dApp level in action.


### Middlewares
Middlewares
In certain scenarios, not all required data can be obtained from a single data source. Consider a blockchain indexer as a data source without any pricing information. Analogous to oracles, middlewares allow augmenting the sourced data with additional off-chain sources.

Each entity within a pipeline progresses through a series of middlewares specified in the pipeline configuration. Middlewares have the power to augment or replace ```metrics``` and ```meta``` fields of the entity.

A good example of middleware is the [Coingecko](./src/middlewares/collection/coingecko/wallet-token-price.middleware.ts), which allows to enrich [WalletToken](./src/entities/wallet-token.entity.ts) with tokens' prices if none were available in the data source.


### Mappers
Mappers, acting as transformative agents, convert arrays of entities acquired from data sources into a serialized data structure, i.e., a _data shape_. 

This structure can be further utilized in other services or seamlessly displayed through compatible DotSight UI widgets. Each mapper in a data pipeline possesses a unique identifier that must be specified when executing the pipeline.

Every mapper extends the capabilities of the [AbstractMapper](./src/mappers/abstract.mapper.ts) class. An exemplary instance is the [Distribution](./src/mappers/collection/distribution/distribution.mapper.ts) mapper, which effectively transforms data into a distribution format.

## Roadmap & Current Focus

DotSight is under active development.

- Aug 2023 The data sources, middlewares, and mappers logic are all functional. Arbitrary data sources are supported, and a collection of default sources is available.
- Nov 2023 DotSight UI Widgets (existing pipelines visualization)
- Q4 2023 DotSight customizable no-code UI 
- Q4 2023 Dockerized Deployment
- Q4 2023 First developer bounties
- Q4 2023 SQL Querying via DotSight UI
- Q1 2024 Extensive library of data sources and UI widgets

## Contributing
We welcome contributions from the developer community to fork, enhance, and improve DotSight. To contribute, please follow these steps:
1. Fork the DotSight repository and create a new branch for your contribution.
2. Make the necessary changes and submit a pull request.
3. Ensure that all continuous integration (CI) checks pass successfully.
4. Ensure that your contribution has sufficient test coverage.
5. Submit your PR and participate in the discussion with the project maintainers.

### Guidelines
This section contains various agreements that make DotSight's codebase performant & readable.
#### DotSight core
##### Database interactions
1. If you are creating a method that queries the database, it can either throw an error when nothing is found or return null. To make things more predictable, you should name your method ```find*``` if it throws and ```query*``` if it returns null.
#### DotSight's Data Sources
1. The data source's constructor should always validate its config and throw ```AbstractDataSource.DataSourceWrongConfig``` if validation fails.
#### DotSight's Mappers
1. Mapper's constructor should always validate its config and throw ```AbstractMapper.MapperWrongConfig``` if validation fails.

## Testing and Quality Assurance
Please make sure your PRs come with sufficient unit test coverage:
1. For any new class logic and functions, you're welcome to add corresponding unit tests under ```.spec.ts```.
2. Validate that the coverage is sufficient via ```npm run test:cov```
