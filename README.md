## Quick Start
After cloning the DotSight repository and ensuring you have `node` v18, `npm` v9, and `docker` v20, or above:

```bash
# install all necessary dependencies
npm ci
```
```bash
# populate and review the environment variables
cp .env.example .env 
```
```bash
# start the environment
docker compose up -d 
```
```bash
# populate the database for the first run
npm run typeorm:run-migrations 
```
```bash
# initiate a development instance (authentication disabled)
npm run start:dev

# initiate a production instance (specify authentication tokens in .env)
npm run start
```

## Testing and Quality Assurance
Please make sure your PRs come with sufficient unit test coverage:
1. For any new class logic and functions, you're welcome to add corresponding unit tests under ```.spec.ts```.
2. Validate that the coverage is sufficient via ```npm run test:cov```
